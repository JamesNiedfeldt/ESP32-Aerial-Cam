# ESP32 Aerial Camera
This is a modified version of jameszah's [ESP32-CAM-Video-Recorder-junior](https://github.com/jameszah/ESP32-CAM-Video-Recorder-junior). I am still working on getting everything working properly with Git and Arduino IDE and will update this readme as I organize code and figure things out.
***
The file `arduino/sketchbook/ESP32-CAM-Video-Recorder-junior-04a/private_settings.h` is ignored but is necessary for the program to connect to the internet. It should contain personal settings related to WiFi and picture quality settings as outlined in `settings.h.sample`. Copy and paste that file (but do *not* delete), and rename the newly made file `settings.h` to change your settings there.
